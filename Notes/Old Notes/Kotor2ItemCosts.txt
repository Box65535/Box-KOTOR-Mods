We will now embark on the journey of pricing every item in the game.

Good luck.










Actually, we might do this instead in the actual txt documents of the
items themselves.


lol

I'll keep this open for some notes



Okay so we're doing the weapon upgrades in a special way. Since there are
always 15 of them, we'll follow the following curve to get the prices.

200
250
300
350
450
550
675
825
1025
1250
1525
1875
2275
2800
3425


We can multiply by this curve by some constant to get individual
upgrade costs



Armor upgrades we'll do individually since there are 30 of those
