Okay that's all the upgrades. We need to actually decide how we're going
to determine their crafting prerequisites.

Remember we can also use level.

Most things should obviously depend on Repair and Computer Use. I was
thinking of anything that has to do with energy could be based on
Computer Use.

Excpetions for other skills should only be made in exceptional
circumstances. I don't think there should be any planned use of Stealth,
Security, Awareness, Demolitions, or Treat Injury.

As for the min and max. I think most upgrades should have the lowest
skill level for crafting be 6. The maximum can be like 26 or something.

Lastly, I think the different types of upgrades can be done in parallel
rather than avoiding intersections between upgrade skill requirements.
