Idk man
Vitality is just so dynamic in this game that keeping up with it is hard
Welllllll
Basically we just want there to be an advantage to units who choose to put investment into healing
But we still want to be able to do healing without that investment since it's so important
One major problem is that we need to slowly introduce better healing items regardless of investment
So maybe instead of a regular progression, we evolve into more complicated healing items
This time we'll start with human healing items since they're more important
We'll also go in 'chrnological' order to try to understand how these items interact


One thing to keep in mind is that the goal of changing medpacs to the way they are now is to discourage medpac games in battle
Instead of doing this crap with times and stuff, it might be easier to just make medpacs only work outside of battle or something

Regardless, I don't like the current proposals for medpacs

Okay here we go now
