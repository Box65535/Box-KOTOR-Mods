These are things found throughout my playthrough that need to be fixed:

+ means fixed
- means not fixed

-Workbenches don't reduce Computer Use bonuses
-Medstation on the Harbinger doesn't give the prompt and subsequently doesn't
work correctly
-Many, many free feats aren't granted, especially for the Exile
-Dark Padawan Robe has 1 Defense
-Echani Heavy Armor seems wrong
-Merchants still get random items
+Gloves don't cost the right amount
+Some Belts don't cost the right amount
-Some merchants don't seem to have all the items I thought would be there
-Some of the tougher enemies have really high saving throws
?Characters seem to be leveling a bit slow at the beginning, this affects some skill
checks, esepecially against persuade, consider giving a bonus to that skill somewhere
+Maybe Bao-Dur should be able to get Class Skill: Demolitions since there's no one else
to disarm all the mines on Telos surface except a Jedi Guardian Exile
+Maybe some character's starting skills shouldn't be so low
-Getting skill feats doesn't give bonuses to those skills' base values, maybe consider
finding a way to give bonuses of +2 instead?
+I think I'm going go switch a few things around with the Tech Spec class, mainly with
feats, giving more feat choices rather than free feats
+The fix for breaking down items depending on the character seems wrong since we only have
a SkillEffectDecrease instead of an if statement for when it needs to be increased
?Enemy remains still give items instead of credits/components/chemicals
?Lt. Green gives Alblative Plating Mark II for completing a minor quest, this is way too
much of a reward (look at the script a_give_q_reward, this may fix some things)
-Implant costs seem to be wrong
+The game is too hard in general, enemies deal too much damage
?Force powers are pretty weak so far
+Heal power is too strong for how early we are and how low VP is
+Concentration and Affect feats are mixed up
+The mod really really becomes too hard too quickly at least so far, we need to fully
reconsider the class stats and maybe not nerfing them so much instead of just relying
on autobalance.2da
*Some of the heavy characters don't have the right model and look rediculous, you can surely
present this to the modding community and they won't think you're crazy if you say that it
isn't supposed to look like that
