This is where we detail the weapons that enemies will use
I think it makes sense to create a unique set of weapons for enemies maybe different baseitems too

All Spell weapons are 1 min cooldown weapons
Exception is turrets which are unlimited use

Not sure about Armor, may add it later but it's not necessarily required to complete these sets

So let's start at the beginning
