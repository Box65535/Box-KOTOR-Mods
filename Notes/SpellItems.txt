
Alright

We need to come to a thing about all of the types of spell items in the game

We've got:
-Loose Grenades
-Grenade/Rocket Launchers
-Energy Weapons
-Energy Projectile Weapons
-Energy Shields
-Stimulants
-Mines
-Turrets Etc

Now we need to figure out how each of them work:

Energy Shields
-Equipped item, uses Use/Minute 
-For humans, equipped on left arm
-For droids, equipped on shield slot
-Base item is based on actual energy shields w/ feat requirements

Stimulants
-Equipped item, uses Use/Minute
-Humans only, equipped on left arm
-Uses gui_inject sound effect
-Base item is based on energy shield

Mines
-Set like in vanilla, from inventory
-Enemy mines should recover to chemicals
-If recovering to chemicals is impossible, use an unusable mine

Turrets Etc
-Equipped item, uses Use/Minute
-For humans, equipped on glove slot
-For droids, equipped on tool slot
-Uses gui_repair sound effect
-If it can be found, uses trap set sound effect
-Base item is based on energy shield
-Trap set animation would be preferred
-On activation, creates a creature (floating mine, turret, droid)
-Script will deduct components or fail if insufficient components are had
-Script needs to send a signal to destroy other turrets etc
-These might actually be too hard to pull off if the they try to do things during cutscenes for example, might have to disable in certain modules

Energy Weapons
-Uses two items, an equipped item and an activation trigger
-For humans, equipped on right arm
-For droids, equpped on either weapon slot
-The equipped item is a Use/Minute, self targeting
-When the equipped item is used, it checks the feats of the user in order to determine which activation trigger to create
-All other activation triggers are removed
-For droids, the activation trigger is equipped to the monster item slot
-For humans, the activation trigger is unique to the user and placed in the inventory
-We may have to make droid activation triggers work like human ones unfortunately
-Activation triggers are Charge/Use
-Activation triggers should check that the proper item is equipped before working, if it isn't there, destroy the item

Energy Projectile Weapons
-Same as energy weapons but with activation triggers that trigger projectile scripts

Grenade/Rocket Launchers
-Uses three items, an equipped item, an ammo item, and an activation trigger
-For humans, equipped on right arm
-For droids, equpped on either weapon slot
-Ammo is an equippable to the monster weapon slots
-Launcher is Use/Minute, takes ammo weapons from inventory and equips them to slots, sets up appropriate trigger
-Trigger is an infinite use item, takes one ammo weapon off the equipment per use and on the last one it disappears itself
-There's an unload trigger that will unequip the ammo items and repopulates the ammo items in the inventory

Loose Grenades
-Uses two items, a disposible item, ammo, and a trigger
-The disposible item is a one time use, it stocks the grenade slots with grenades of that type
-The trigger this time is a Use/Minute instead of infinite use, it also blows itself up when 
-The grenades are like grenades for grenade launchers


So basically, we can't implement all of these types of things in the first version of this mod, we'll do the easy ones and then leave the other ones for later versions

Anyway, let's do the fun part where we actually create the items

The above implementations are only proposed, they are not finalized

Based on these, the sequencing should be:
Feat 1 = 6 Energy
Feat 2 = 12 Energy
Feat 3 = 18 Energy

Also, energy can regenerate approximately 1 point per 6-10 seconds depending on what is convenient with heartbeat scripts, alternately, we could lean toward 12-20 seconds for regen and have the feats also increase the rate of energy recovery by 2x and 3x
