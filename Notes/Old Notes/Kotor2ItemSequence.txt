Here are the spots in the game where you can make/buy new items:



Peragus:
-Medlab next to the morgue
-Workbench near HK-50
-Medlab and Workbench in crew quarters

Harbinger:
-Medlab near Kolto tanks
-Workbench after Kriea leaves

Ebon Hawk:
-Workbench and Medlab

Citadel Station:
-Workbench and Medlab on station
-Dendis Dobo shop
-Samhan Dobo shop
-Samhan Dobo Black Market store
-Chano's Droid shop

Telos Surface:
-Nothing

Telos Military Base:
-Workbench and Medlab

Telos Academy:

Ebon Hawk
-Workbench and Medlab




After this, we'll assume that workbenches and medlabs are always
available due to the fact that one can always come back to the
Ebon Hawk




Nar Shaadda:
-Geeda's shop
-Oondar's shop
-Kodin's droid shop

Dantooine:
-Adum's shop
-Akkere's droid shop

M4-78:

Dxun:

And there are no other shops after this, only workbenches
and medlabs.
