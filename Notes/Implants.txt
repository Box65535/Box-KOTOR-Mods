Here's an alternate idea:

Each implant is a blank slate to be upgraded, each feat level unlocks another slot for upgrades

+2 Reflex

Charisma Implant
+1 Persuade

Nerve Enhancement Implant

Strength Implant
+1 Str

Cardio Implant
+1 Con


Level 2 Upgrades:

Dexterity Implant

Awareness Implant
+2 Awareness
Immune Sneak Attack

Bio-Antidote Implant
Immune Poison

Nerve Enhancement Implant
Immune Fear

Fitness Implant

Level 3 Upgrades:

+2 Saves vs Mind Affecting

Health Implant
2 Regen

Charisma Implant

We need to work on names, but this is actually pretty good
Implants being the only items to improve mental abilities gives them a niche
