Alright so we need to review the build strategy to start putting things together:

Basic Steps:

1. Run gengen
2. Copy/Rearrange modified files
3. Compile scripts
4. Run TSLPatcher
5. Compile remaining modified scripts
6. Run TSLPatcher overwrites.ini

Really 3-6 are the same as since before gengen was created

How do we organize our files?

Two folders:
-Mod = Mod source
-Temp = Workplace for doing the install

Top level view:
-Mod/
-Temp/
-install.bat

In Mod/
-Scripts/
-Generators/
-Tables/
-GFFs/
-Blanks/
-Overwrites/
-Strings/
-INIs/
-Dependencies/
-Infos/
-Old/

I think it's pretty self-explanatory what's in each subfolder, Infos is where you put info.rtf for each TSLPatcher step


In Temp/
-tslpatchdata/

Aside from tslpatchdata, I think everything else is ephemeral
