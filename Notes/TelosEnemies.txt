
Here we will document the identities of enemies we think need to be modified

201TEL (Citadel Station Dock):


201_tsf_ith - TSF ithorian guard
201thug* - Thugs that attack you when you pick up the ithorian droid
n_samhan - Samhan Dobo in sting operation (grenade)
n_repoff001 - Leiutenant Grenn (cutscene or sting operation)
n_repsold001 - Also Leiutenant Grenn ?
n_tsfoff002 - TSF Officer, not sure what he does but has a rifle

(There's a few other people I didn't find, in the sting operation from the other side you fight 2 TSF Officers and a TSF Leiutenant who I didn't find)
(You also might be able to fight the Ithorian at the droid exchange, not sure)
(Regardless, you do kill another ithorian)

202TEL (Entertainment Module) - This is outside the cantina

203_merc002 - Rifle merc, weapon unequipped

n_tsfgf/gm - TSF Officers
n_202_rem - Batu Rem assassin (dual blasters)

207TEL - Cantina, don't think there are any battles here

208TEL - Exchange, Almost everyone here is fightable and self-explanatory

209TEL - Czerka??

203_merc0* - These are the same mercs that try to attack ithorians, they attack czerka
203_merc* - The ones without a 0 seems to be the regular mercs who don't fight
merc_bguard - guessing these are also aggro mercs

221TEL - Telos Part 2, I think this is the landing area, mostly self-explanatory

222TEL - Telos Part 2, Entertainment Module, 

(You should probably do Telos Part 2 stuff later since it's endgame)

231TEL - Telos Surface, Probably Landing Area, Self-Explanatory

232TEL - Underground Base, All one map, Mostly enemies

233TEL - Czerka Base Site,
