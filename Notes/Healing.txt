Alright so I think we're not doing healing items, instead we'll just try to make healing very straightforward and equitable for all

We're also very likely not doing Treat Injury/Repair involvement in healing



Medpac
40 Healing (10/2 for 8 seconds) 
Target can't move for 8 seconds
Single Use

Antidote Pack
Removes Poison
Target can't move for 8 seconds
Single Use

Advanced Medpac
80 Healing (20/2 for 8 seconds)
Target can't move for 8 seconds
Single Use

Advanced Antidote Pack
Removes Poison
Removes Attribute Damage
Target can't move for 8 seconds
Single Use

Life Support Pack
60 Healing (Immediate)
-4 Str/Dex/Wis for 30 Seconds
Single Use



Another option would be to do percentages
But that has problems because these things are supposed to be a fixed price

We might just need 3 levels


Medpac/Kit 1
40 Healing (10/2 for 8 seconds) 
Target can't move for 8 seconds
Single Use

Medpac/Kit 2
80 Healing (20/2 for 8 seconds) 
Target can't move for 8 seconds
Single Use

Medpac/Kit 3
120 Healing (30/2 for 8 seconds) 
Target can't move for 8 seconds
Single Use

Antidote Pack (Human only)
Removes Poison
Target can't move for 8 seconds
Single Use

Life Support Pack / Quick Fix Kit 1
40 Healing (Immediate)
-4 Str/Dex/Wis for 30 Seconds
Single Use

Life Support Pack / Quick Fix Kit 2
80 Healing (Immediate)
-4 Str/Dex/Wis for 30 Seconds
Single Use


Anything else?

There's actually a lot of potential flexibility here
But I think that's better kept for Stims/etc
These items are supposed to be basic healing
I might even remove the Life Support Packs, maybe
