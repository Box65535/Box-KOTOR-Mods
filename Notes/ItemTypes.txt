Let's take stock of what types of items are in this mod now that testing revealed everything is busted:



Melee Weapons
Ranged Weapons
Lightsabers

Human Armor
Droid Armor

Melee Upgrades
Ranged Upgrades
Saber Upgrades
Armor Upgrades

Stealth Fields
Saving Throw Belts

Implaint Containers
Implant Upgrades
(Implant Combinations)

Energy Shields
Stimulant Packages
Droid Energy Shields

Grenade Launchers etc
Grenade Ammo etc
Ammo Boxes
Energy Weapons

Medpacs
Repair Kits
Grenades

Turret Controllers
Turrets
Mines


That's a lot of items left, I think the only ones you have done are the weapons/armor/upgrades
Still, shouldn't be too hard, it's mostly a matter of grinding through all of the spell scripts
