Geg
store_geg.utm

For reference, it seems that the enhanced merchants mod works by 
putting certain modified merchant files in the override folder.
These merchants have more equipment but obviously this doens't account
for everything since there's still something that adds random equipment
to merchants. In order to fix merchants, we need to get rid of that.
It might be a script.

The merchants modified are as follows:
kexxstore002.utm
kodinstore.utm
m_202_001.utm
m_202_002.utm
m_202_003.utm
m_chano.utm
margar_store.utm
store_128.utm
store_adum.utm
store_daraala.utm
store_geg.utm

That doesn't necessarily account for all the merchats. This mod was really
lazy.



Anyway, we need to look for if there's a script that stocks the merchants
with random items because that really needs to be taken out if we want
to avoid some crazy workaround for random merchant inventory.



Alright I still can't find the script. We'll go without it for now.

We know that we can edit the merchants by putting replacements in the
Overwrite folder so let's just start with that.

Which merchants are we really concerned with?:


Oondar
Kex
Geeda
Tienn
Dendis Dobo
Black Market
Samhan Dobo
Chano
Margar
Adum
Akkere
Daarala
Geg


and then there's the myserious Store 128



Now what types of items do they carry?

Oondar - good supply of general stuff, decidedly above average
Kex - Mandalorian focused military supplies
Geeda - starts out with not much, gets better equipment over time
Tienn - Upgrades or Droid parts.... I can't remember
Dendis Dobo - General stuff someone on telos would need
Black Market - Advanced equipment for someone on telos
Samhan Dobo - Similar stuff to Dendis, perhaps same inventory
Chano - Upgrades I believe, either that or droid parts
Margar - Idk.. general stuff?
Adum - General stuff
Akkere - Droid stuff
Daarala - Jedi stuff
Geg - Basic stuff

Second, we need to specify what types of equipment there is:

Light Armor
Medium Armor
Heavy Armor
Jedi Robes
Melee Weapons
Blaster Pistols
Blaster Rifles
Repeating Blasters (Heavy or otherwise)
Lightsabers
Stealth Belts
Power Belts
Power Gloves
Tech Belts
Tech Gloves

Armor Gloves
Implants
Energy Shields
Headgear
Mines
Grenades
Rockets
Medpacs
Stimulants

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
This is a problem, the items don't really fan out ideally
We really need more custom merchants or something, Kotor 1 had better merchants, here there just aren't enough, idk

Alright, yeah, no, I already came up with a better idea before
We just create one merchant in the Ebon Hawk who can sell all of the stuff
This merchant would be like the Star Wars equivalent of online shopping, whatever

Anyway, this all means we're not worrying about merchants this iteration




According to Fair Strides, the person who worked on the K1 Restoration, this is what would be needed to be made to add a merchant:

1. A .dlg file for the conversation
2. A script to open the store
3. A .utm file which is the merchant
4. A .utp file which is the placeable scenery object (whose conversation field is the name of the .dlg)
