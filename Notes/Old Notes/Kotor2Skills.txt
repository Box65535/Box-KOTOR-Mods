This file is for the idea of changing the skills
around a bit and what that would affect:

Here are the current skills:
Computer Use
Demolitions
Stealth
Awareness
Persuade
Repair
Security
Treat Injury

And here is what would it would change to:
Computer Use	->	Crafting
Demolitions	->	Demolitions
Stealth		->	Stealth
Awareness	->	Awareness
Persuade	->	Persuade
Repair		->	Repair
Security	->	Computer Use
Treat Injury	->	Treat Injury

And here is the main effect of those skills:
Crafting	- Crafting, Synthesizing
Demolitions	- Explosives Bonus
Stealth		- Stealth Fields
Awareness	- Detecting Hidden Things
Persuade	- No Main Effect
Repair		- Parts, Shields, Kits
Computer Use	- Locks, Spikes
Treat Injury	- Using Medpacs

Here are the conversation effects:
Crafting	- None
Demolitions	- Demolitions
Stealth		- Stealth
Awareness	- Awareness
Persuade	- Persuade
Repair		- Repair
Computer Use	- Security/Comp
Treat Injury	- Treat Injury
Basically, the way this works is that
each conversation is individually decided
but these are the general categories from
what they were in the original game

Here are the effects for droids:
Crafting	- None
Demolitions	- None
Stealth		- None
Awareness	- None
Persuade	- None
Repair		- Repair Kit Bonus
Computers	- Droid Weapon Bonus
Treat Injury	- None


So at this point, the skills to seem a
little unbalanced and maybe a bit
arbitrary but that's kind of how they
were before so it's not the biggest deal.

Anyway, let's move on to class skills
since that's pretty important.
