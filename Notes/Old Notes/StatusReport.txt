We need to bring some sensibility to this project, we need to know what has been completed


Right now, I just want to know which items have been implemented, the following seem to be done:
-Ranged Weapons and Upgrades
-Melee Weapons and Upgrades
-Armor and Upgrades
-Belts and Gloves
-Droid Upgrades (Mounts and Tools)
-Robes
-Implants
-Droid Armor
*Lightsabers and Upgrades (Lightsaber Crystals might have issues, Colors not accounted for)



And for all the items listed, we have not determined prices, we'll work on that later

For our stage in the project, we just need to work on getting the remaining items done\


-------------------------------------



Okay so I think we did all of the equippable items so now we just have to check to make sure the consumables work

We do have to grab them though to make sure we can adjust prices so there's that


Completed Consumables:
-Grenades
-Mines
-Medpacs
-Stimulants
-Energy Shields
-Droid Weapons
-Droid Shields


Alright Consumables are done


Anything Else?

Headgear?

Well we're not really using those so I say ignore them



-------------------------------------------------


Now we want to briefly verify the item scripts:

Scripts checked:
-Medpacs
-Repair Kits
-Shields
-Stimulants
-Grenades
-Droid Weapons
-Mines


Well that was boring

But it's done at least for now, so that's good



------------------------------------------------------

The next thing to do would be to check that all of the force powers work the way they are intended, just like we did for the scripts

The thing is that I KNOW that I did this recently so I might just half-heartedly check it


Yeah, I'm going to assume this is good


-----------------------------------------------------

Okay now we have to do crafting

The first thing is to list out all of the craftable items and decide at what level they are craftable
We're not going anywhere near the whole skill debate, we're just determining the raw level at which these items should be craftable

We're also not worrying about crafting feats this iteration, just the level


Alright well we got that done


I had an inspiration about how to do consumables differently which might make the skills work better too but we'll see
At the very least, it's not something we need to worry about in this iteration probably
Probably
Well maybe not, but there are things we have to do regardless
Either way, we can't assess the viability until we go in and test a few things
So we have to press on regardless, maybe just forget about the consumables for now



-----------------------------------------------------

The next step in crafting is to check/implement the scripts for workbenches and medstations

We might have a slight problem when dealing with the whole "how much do you get back for decomposing" but we'll figure it out

Alright well that works for now based on what we have


----------------------------------------------------

Now we want to implement the 2das for craftables
Since we're not doing rockets make itemcreate and itemcreatemira identical

There might be a problem with the custom items having to adjust their tag in the .uti files to become available in the crafting menu
We can test that later though, right now we just need to lay it out

Since the whole crafting thing kinda needs to be tested to be verified, we really skimped out on doing this right
We will need to come back to this pretty much in full after figuring out how all of the upgrades work


----------------------------------------------------

Alright so I guess next we should make sure the random treasure scripts are working the way we think they should

Well I feel relatively confident in the treasure scripts though they definately need to be tested and checked etc


----------------------------------------------------

Alright well I'm getting impatient and this seems like as good a time as any to try to boot up the mod and see what it can do
Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, we have to figure out what's going on in the override folder first.........

Alright well I think I got all of the crap out of there
Let's add ranged weapons and try to see if we can craft and upgrade.
We'll need to compile the crafting scripts and include the appropriate 2da and uti files.

As I suspected, in order to use upgrades, it seems that we need to include them in a 2da file or change their tag
Alright well, it seems as if the most sane way to do these upgrades is to simply override the names of upgrades that they can replace
That means we'll have to use the old names in the workbench 2da file as well

NO, WAIT
IT WAS THE NAMING CONVENTION, IT WAS TOO LONG SO IT GOT CUT OFF
OKAY, LETS DO SOME VARIATIONS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS

Okay so here's what we need to do:
Choose a new naming convention where all of the upgrade names are short
Modify the tag and template of all of the upgrade items to match new names
Use the modified name in both the itemcreate and upgrade 2da files

---------------------------------------------------------

Okay okay we did a whole lot of experimentation with consumables and we have a number of different possibilities on how to implement
Now I think we need to take a step back from that and try to get done some of the rote work that needs to happen regardless
So let's work on getting all of the items and upgrades in the game proper

We need a naming scheme that accomplishes several things:
-All items are easy to identify by name
-All names are 11 characters or fewer
-When sorted by name, related items are grouped together
-Names should be relatively easy to type

So I think based on this, it's best to do something similar to Kotor 2's naming scheme

We start out with 2 characters that determine what kind of item this is for example:

wm = melee weapon
wr = ranged weapon
um = melee upgrade
ha = human armor
da = droid armor
he = human equipment
hi = human item

Then we have an underscore
The next part of the name should describe the item in 6 characters or less
Finally there should be 2 digits for numbers if necessary

For example:
wm_vibro1 = vibroblade

For vibro1 is easier to type than vbrbld which is kinda weird even though it's more informative so keep such things in mind
Okay? We'll start with upgrades then

Upgrades Completed:
-Melee upgrades
-Ranged upgrades
-Lightsaber upgrades
-Armor upgrades

We've also verified that these upgrades do in fact work as upgrades
I have no tested each individually to make sure the effects are correct though

----------------------------------------------------

Okay so next......... well we should probably figure out what's going on with merchants
Unfortunately we're not sure how consumables are working at the moment....... still though we should be able to put some items in shops
If we ignore consumables, upgrades, and equipment that just leaves weapons and armor which I think we can do
Okay so go to the merchants and decide who's getting what

Okay so we didn't really do merchants but we put it off until the next cycle where we implement the Ebon Hawk internet merchant

---------------------------------------------------

Alright.......... now what
We shoould do a little more testing and come to a decision about consumables

Okay, that was amazing, we actually solved the whole issue, incredibly, truly, go with gusto and create all consumables

Okay, I think we did the designs for consumables at least


-----------------------------------------------------

Where are we at now?
We still need to do traps, we also need to rethink some of the DCs the player team will face

So basically it's back to the scripts, except this time I think you should also give feats a lookover since they need to be updated too
