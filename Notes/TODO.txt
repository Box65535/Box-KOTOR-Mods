Here's what I think still needs to be done:

Required:
-Spell script testing
-Weapon load script writing/testing
-Integrating feat constants into scripts
-Poison.2da
-Enemy hides/script assignment
-Skill changes
-Party characters
-Crafting

Extra:
-Item costs - decide and implement
-Merchants - need to figure out HOW then do
-Feat descriptions
-
