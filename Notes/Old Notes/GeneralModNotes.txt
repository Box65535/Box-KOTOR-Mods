Here are some scripts that I've just found that you should watch out for.



k_inc_drop.nss - This says it determines random drops for creatures but
I'm not sure if it's leftover from Kotor 1 or used in Kotor 2

k_inc_item_gen.nss - This script does stuff for when you ask a party
member for a specific item. Be careful modifying because it may not
line up with the dialogue.

k_inc_generic.nss - This has a lot of stuff. You should check what it
all is sometime.
