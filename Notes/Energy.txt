Let's try these again:

New Feats:

Weapon Proficiency - Energy Weapons
(Prereq for energy weapons - 8 Energy)
Weapon Proficiency - Heavy Energy Weapons
(Prereq for double energy weapons)

Weapon Focus - Energy Weapons
(+4 Energy and x1.5 Regen - Level 7 Req)
Weapon Focus - Energy Weapons
(+4 Energy and x1.5 Regen - Level 15 Req)


Basically we have the following categories for energy weapons:
-Electric
-Ion
-Sonic
-Plasma
-Stun
-Hack

There are some other potential ones but I want to start with these

Each of the above has two variations
-Electric: Single Target vs Chain Targeting
-Ion: Blast vs Beam
-Sonic: Blast vs Wave
-Plasma: Blast vs Beam

We haven't adequately distinguished blasts vs beams yet...

Well we could try making blasts the more powerful but more costly versions of what the beams are, idk

Man this could be much bigger than I originally imagined, there are lots of potential combos:

Ion/Plasma
Stun/Electric
Ion/Electric (Can use Ionize animation)
Sonic/Disrupt
Stun/Hack
Ion/Hack

Will need to come back to this

Also, would be cool if Bao-Dur could use energy weapons since his left arm is locked (hopefully)







May 2016

Glad I didn't get too far into this because my idea for how this would work doesn't work, I think instead I'll either do the Use / X Minutes or the X Uses / Day for individual weapons

We'll still have 3 total feats for energy weapons mainly because I don't want to change them. I might reorder them though.

Actually we had 4 before..... 2 for the weapons and 2 for the upgrades.......

If you need another feat, you can always just eat the Bowcasters feat and then make bowcasters use the wookie toughness feat or something
