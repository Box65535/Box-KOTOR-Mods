Stimulants don't need to be that radical, but they should be at least useful


Adrenal Strength
+4 Str for 40 Seconds
2 Minute Recharge

Adrenal Stamina
+4 Con for 40 Seconds
2 Minute Recharge

Adrenal Alacrity
+4 Dex for 40 Seconds
2 Minute Recharge



Stimulants:


Strengthening Stimulant
+4 Str for 40 Seconds
+4 Fort/Reflex for 40 Seconds
2 Minute Recharge

Toughening Stimulant
+4 Con for 40 Seconds
+20% Damage Immunity for 40 Seconds
Immune to Paralysis for 40 Seconds
2 Minute Recharge

Focusing Stimulant
+4 Dex for 40 Seconds
+4 Will for 40 Seconds
+2 Attack for 40 Seconds
Immune to Fear for 40 Seconds
2 Minute Recharge


I think these are decent


Here's an alternate take:

Battle Stimulant
+4 Str for 40 Seconds
+2 Damage for 40 Seconds
+4 Saves for 40 Seconds
2 Minute Recharge

Endurance Stimulant
+4 Con for 40 Seconds
40 Healing (2/2 for 40 seconds)
Remove Poison
Immune to Poison/Paralysis for 40 Seconds
2 Minute Recharge

Agility Stimulant
+4 Dex for 40 Seconds
+1 Extra Move for 40 Seconds
2 Minute Recharge


These are actually pretty darn good, maybe a little too good
Keep in mind, these are supposed to be better than energy shields because they have a longer cooldown, probably the longest cooldown of any item/weapon
