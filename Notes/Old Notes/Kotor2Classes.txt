In this file, we're going to try to really document what the class stats and balances are
for this mod.

This is a pretty important part of the game, so it's going to involve A LOT of revisions,
right now we're just trying to get everything down [actually scratch that, we're going to
remake the classes as we go, update things to conform to this list]

Also, remember that not every individual in the game is 100% beholden to his/her class
stats so we may also have to list pseudo-classes for specific characters






Solider

Characters:	Mandalore, Handmaiden, Disciple

Vitality	- 8 per Level
Skills		- 1 per Level
Feats		- 14 by Level 30
Force		- 1 per Level
Force Powers 	- None

Attack		- 18 by Level 30
Defense		- 5 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 13 by Level 30
Reflex		- 8 by Level 30
Will		- 7 by Level 30

-Melee Weapons			- Level 1
-Power Equipment 1		- Level 1
-Increase Combat Damage I	- Level 9
-Increase Combat Damage II	- Level 18
-Increase Combat Damage III	- Level 27


Comments:
The tricky part about this class is that it comes at the wrong point in the game. Most of
the Soldier characters come pretty late and ideally this is a basic meatshield class that
you want to use early on to set a baseline for combat ability. If we consider changing
this class, it should be to make it less generic and more specialized toward a specific
type of combat. Okay well I just reduced the vitality to 8 so 



Scout

Characters:	Mira, Hanharr

Vitality	- 6 per Level
Skills		- 2 per Level
Feats		- 17 by Level 30
Force		- 1 per Level
Force Powers 	- None

Attack		- 18 by Level 30
Defense		- 5 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 10 by Level 30
Reflex		- 10 by Level 30
Will		- 10 by Level 30

Class Skills:
-Awareness:	Free

-Repair:	Feat Available
-Stealth:	Feat Available

Free Feats:
-Armor Level 1			- Level 1
-Blasters			- Level 1
-Advanced Blasters		- Level 1
-Melee Weapons			- Level 1


Comments:
This class seems to be a foil to the Scoundrel class. The Scout seems to be more offensively
focused while the Scoundrel is more defensive. Both have a focus on skills over combat. If
the Scout and Scoundrel characters were introduced at the same time, it would work better
but the fact is that we're stuck with Atton as the main beatstick for a good while until
the game gets going. Either way, I think this class is pretty good based on theory alone.
I have yet to test it.



Scoundrel

Characters:	Atton

Vitality	- 6 per Level
Skills		- 2 per Level
Feats		- 14 by Level 30
Force		- 1 per Level
Force Powers 	- None

Attack		- 15 by Level 30
Defense		- 9 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 8 by Level 30
Reflex		- 13 by Level 30
Will		- 7 by Level 30

Class Skills:
-Security:	Free
-Awareness:	Free
-Stealth:	Feat Available
-Computer Use:	Feat Available
-Demolitions:	Feat Available

Free Feats:
-Armor Level 1			- Level 1
-Blasters			- Level 1
-Advanced Blasters		- Level 1
-Melee Weapons			- Level 1
-Stealth Field Generators	- Level 1
-Sneak Attack I			- Level 1
-Sneak Attack II		- Level 5
-Sneak Attack III		- Level 9
-Sneak Attack IV		- Level 13
-Sneak Attack V			- Level 17
-Sneak Attack VI		- Level 21
-Sneak Attack VII		- Level 25
-Sneak Attack VIII		- Level 29
-Sneak Attack IX		- Level 33
-Sneak Attack X			- Level 37


Comments:
This is the big problem class. It's not quite powerful enough to stand on it's own as the
big beatstick class for a major portion of the game. If you choose Consular, Atton is your
strongest character from a vitality and attack standpoint and it just doesn't quite work.
On the other hand, you can't really mess with the class too much because it betrays people's
expectations. Either way, I changed the whole Sneak Attack thing because it's actually
fairly powerful and can get rediculous pretty quickly if you're attacking a stunned
opponent. A slight nerf was in order.



Tech Specialist

Characters:	Bao-Dur

Vitality	- 6 per Level
Skills		- 2 per Level
Feats		- 17 by Level 30
Force		- 1 per Level
Force Powers 	- None

Attack		- 12 by Level 30
Defense		- 5 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 8 by Level 30
Reflex		- 8 by Level 30
Will		- 8 by Level 30

Class Skills:
-Repair:	Free
-Computer Use:	Free
-Security:	Feat Available
-Awareness:	Feat Available
-Demolitions:	Feat Available
-Treat Injury:	Feat Available

Free Feats:
-Armor Level 1			- Level 1
-Blasters			- Level 1
-Advanced Blasters		- Level 1
-Melee Weapons			- Level 1


-Tech Equipment 1		- Level 1

Comments:
This class isn't the greatest. It's a little too weak for Bao-Dur, who you have to use to
fight all those mercenaries. There's also the worry about now increasing the skill points
since that gives a Bao-Dur with 14 skill 4 skill points per level, which is potentially
enough to just easily get high ranks in almost every skill.



Expert Droid

Characters:	T3-M4, G0-T0

Vitality	- 6 per Level
Skills		- 2 per Level
Feats		- 11 by Level 30
Force		- 0 per Level

Attack		- 13 by Level 30
Defense		- 4 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 8 by Level 30
Reflex		- 8 by Level 30
Will		- 8 by Level 30

Class Skills:
-Security:	Free
-Computer Use:	Free
-Awareness:	Feat Available
-Repair:	Feat Available
-Demolitions:	Feat Available

Free Feats:
-Droid Light Armor		- Level 1
-Blasters			- Level 1


Comments:
I'm pretty satisfied with this class so far. T3-M4 didn't seem that weak. He's got various
droid equipment to help him and you don't really have to rely on him that much for fighting.
The skill points are a little high for G0-T0 with an intelligence of 16.



Combat Droid

Characters:	HK-47

Vitality	- 8 per Level
Skills		- 1 per Level
Feats		- 11 by Level 30
Force		- 0 per Level

Attack		- 18 by Level 30
Defense		- 4 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 13 by Level 30
Reflex		- 8 by Level 30
Will		- 7 by Level 30

Class Skills:
-Awareness:	Free
-Repair:	Feat Available
-Demolitions:	Feat Available
-Computer Use:	Feat Available
-Security:	Feat Available

Free Feats:
-Droid Light Armor		- Level 1
-Droid Medium Armor		- Level 1
-Blasters			- Level 1
-Advanced Blasters		- Level 1
-Rifles				- Level 1

Comments:
This class is sort of strange. I'm not sure if I really like it. It's like a more extreme
version of the Soldier class, sacrificing even more for total focus on vitality. This
doesn't seem to be completely within the character of HK-47 who you might suspect could
have more skills or feats or something. Instead, he's this incredibly bulky class. Now,
it's always possible to have HK-47's stats be in large contradition to this class, but
there's still this huge amount of bulk. Consider trading some vitality for more feats.
Okay, well I just did switch to 8 VP and 14 feats so that's a thing now. I also switched
targeting from the Scout to the Combat Droid.



Jedi Guardian

Characters:	Exile, Handmaiden, Disciple

Vitality	- 8 per Level
Skills		- 1 per Level
Feats		- 6 by Level 15 / 11 by Level 30
Force		- 4 per Level

Attack		- 18 by Level 30
Defense		- 6 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 11 by Level 30
Reflex		- 10 by Level 30
Will		- 8 by Level 30

Class Skills:

-Melee Weapons			- Level 1
-Lightsabers			- Level 1
-Force Agility 1		- Level 3
-Force Agility 2		- Level 9
-Force Agility 3		- Level 15


Comments:
For this class, it seems appropriate to go with the Agility feats at least
up until level 2. 



Jedi Sentinel

Characters:	Exile, Visas, Atton

Vitality	- 6 per Level
Skills		- 2 per Level
Feats		- 8 by Level 15 / 14 by Level 30
Force		- 3 per Level
Powers		- 7 by Level 15 / 11 by Level 30

Attack		- 15 by Level 30
Defense		- 6 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 8 by Level 30
Reflex		- 10 by Level 30
Will		- 11 by Level 30

Class Skills:
Exile:
-Awareness	Free
-Computer Use	Free
-Security	Free
-Treat Injry	Feat Available
-Stealth	Feat Available

Allies:
-Awareness:	Free
-Treat Injury:	Feat Available
-Stealth	Feat Available

Free Feats:
-Blasters			- Level 1
-Melee Weapons			- Level 1
-Lightsabers			- Level 1
-Force Immunity 1		- Level 3
-Force Immunity 2		- Level 9
-Force Immunity 3		- Level 15


Comments:
I'm still debating whether to give this class Immunity 1 and/or Protection 1.
I don't want to encourage the use of the shield powers and I don't want to give feats
to a class that doesn't need them but they're both not that great anyway. The
other reason I'm hesistant is because I'm not sure if I want to give Atton and Mira
an immunity to Fear but I suppose it's not the worst thing. 



Jedi Consular

Characters:	Kreia, Bao-Dur

Vitality	- 6 per Level
Skills		- 1 per Level
Feats		- 6 by Level 15 / 11 by Level 30
Force		- 7 per Level
Powers		- 8 by Level 15 / 14 by Level 30

Attack		- 12 by Level 30
Defense		- 8 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 7 by Level 30
Reflex		- 8 by Level 30
Will		- 13 by Level 30

Class Skills:

Exile:
-Awareness	Free
-Repair		Free
-Treat Injry	Feat Available
-Stealth	Feat Available

Kriea:
-Awareness:	Free
-Treat Injury:	Feat Available
-Stealth	Feat Available

Free Feats:
-Blasters			- Level 1
-Melee Weapons			- Level 1
-Lightsabers			- Level 1
-Force Mind Affect 1		- Level 3
-Force Restrain 1		- Level 3
-Force Mind Affect 2		- Level 9
-Force Restrain 2		- Level 9
-Force Mind Affect 3		- Level 15
-Force Restrain 3		- Level 15


Comments:
I still can't figure out the best way to distribute force feats for this class. I think
it's necessary to have something otherwise there's no way to get enough feats. I think
Telekinesis, Mind Affect, and Restrain would be good feats for the Consular so I'm going
with granting them all at low levels for now. I'm afraid to go any higher. I'm also
still not sure about putting Bao-Dur in this class or the Disciple for that matter.
This whole class is warped by Kriea's presence. It seems like Kriea would deserve her
own class but she can't have one because making new classes doesn't work for some reason.












Prestige Classes



Jedi Weapon Master

Vitality	- 8 per Level
Skills		- 1 per Level
Feats		- 5 by Level 15 / 10 by Level 30
Force		- 4 per Level
Powers		- 6 by Level 15 / 14 by Level 30

Attack		- 18 by Level 30
Defense		- 6 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 11 by Level 30
Reflex		- 10 by Level 30
Will		- 8 by Level 30

Class Skills:
-Awareness:	Feat Available
-Treat Inury:	Feat Available

Free Feats:
Deflect Mastery			- Level 1

Comments:
I'm not sure whether Inner Strength and Deflect are actually feats or not. Anyway,
just including deflect here already seems powerful enough since it offers so much
deflection power. It doesn't feel right to backfill on something like Agility.
We'll keep these classes minimal in the free feats they grant. There's already a
lot of feats to be had since the Exile gets so many for free.




Jedi Watchman

Vitality	- 6 per Level
Skills		- 2 per Level
Feats		- 7 by Level 15 / 13 by Level 30
Force		- 3 per Level
Powers		- 7 by Level 15 / 11 by Level 30

Attack		- 15 by Level 30
Defense		- 6 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 7 by Level 30
Reflex		- 8 by Level 30
Will		- 13 by Level 30

Class Skills:
-Awareness:	Free
-Treat Injury:	Free
-Stealth:	Feat Available
-Computer Use:	Feat Available
-Repair:	Feat Available

Free Feats:
None

Comments:
This class gets a lot of available skills and maintains a good feat rate so it doesn't
gain any extra feats. The vitality does seem a bit low so I am considering raising the
prestige class vitalities a bit but not quite yet. There's also the option of granting
a feat like "Prestige Toughness" which would be the master toughness feat. But that
seems like it might not fit so well with the Jedi Master/Sith Lord classes.



Jedi Master

Vitality	- 6 per Level
Skills		- 1 per Level
Feats		- 5 by Level 15 / 10 by Level 30
Force		- 8 per Level
Powers		- 8 by Level 15 / 14 by Level 30

Attack		- 12 by Level 30
Defense		- 6 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 7 by Level 30
Reflex		- 8 by Level 30
Will		- 13 by Level 30

Class Skills:
-Persuade:	Free
-Awareness:	Feat Available
-Treat Inury:	Feat Available
-Stealth:	Feat Available

Free Feats:
Force Mastery 			- Level 1

Comments:
This class seems pretty weak actually but the Force Mastery feat is nothing to scoff at.
This is the place were it really seems like it might be appropriate to buff something
because I'm not sure how much better this class is over the regular Consular.




Sith Marauder

Vitality	- 8 per Level
Skills		- 1 per Level
Feats		- 5 by Level 15 / 10 by Level 30
Force		- 3 per Level
Powers		- 6 by Level 15 / 14 by Level 30

Attack		- 18 by Level 30
Defense		- 6 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 11 by Level 30
Reflex		- 10 by Level 30
Will		- 8 by Level 30

Class Skills:
None

Free Feats:
Ignore Pain 1			- Level 1
Ignore Pain 2			- Level 5
Ignore Pain 3			- Level 9

Comments:
I think Dark side classes should have some noticable differences from their light side
counterparts. Here, the Sith Maurauder loses the class skills although I think technically
there was nothing lost here because the Weapon Master's potential class skills were
already potential class skills for any jedi. Anyway, the Sith Marauder has Ignore Pain.
I think this is adequate except for the fact that it's missing Fury. This is a unique 
power and it seems like a shame to miss out on it. So I'm thinking of making it available
for this class to choose from the spell list instead. I also chose to reduce this class's
force points per level to 4 from 6.




Sith Assassin

Vitality	- 6 per Level
Skills		- 2 per Level
Feats		- 5 by Level 15 / 10 by Level 30
Force		- 3 per Level
Powers		- 7 by Level 15 / 11 by Level 30

Attack		- 15 by Level 30
Defense		- 6 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 7 by Level 30
Reflex		- 8 by Level 30
Will		- 13 by Level 30

Class Skills:
-Awareness:	Free
-Stealth:	Free
-Demolitions:	Feat Available
-Security:	Feat Available

Free Feats:
Force Camoflogue		- Level 1
Sneak Attack V			- Level 3
Sneak Attack VI			- Level 7
Sneak Attack VII		- Level 11
Sneak Attack VIII		- Level 15
Sneak Attack IX			- Level 19
Sneak Attack X			- Level 23

Comments:
This loses some of the feats from the Watchman class to get Force Camoflogue and 
Sneak Attack. Obviously, the class can't make use of all of the Sneak Attack levels.
I'm still not sure to whom Force Camoflogue should be available. It might have to be
a prestige class only feat but I don't think I'd restrict it to this class. We can
easily make the first level restricted which would block off most characters and then
grant the feat manually to Kriea (and Visas?) so that they can take the higher levels.



Sith Lord

Vitality	- 6 per Level
Skills		- 1 per Level
Feats		- 5 by Level 15 / 10 by Level 30
Force		- 6 per Level
Powers		- 8 by Level 15 / 14 by Level 30

Attack		- 12 by Level 30
Defense		- 6 by Level 30

Fortitude	- 7 by Level 30
Reflex		- 8 by Level 30
Will		- 13 by Level 30

Class Skills:
-Persuade:	Free
-Awareness:	Feat Available
-Stealth:	Feat Available

Free Feats:


Comments:
This class sacrifices the Jedi Master's extra Defense. Obviously, this class gets access
to Force Storm exclusively. I'm not sure what else to give to it right now. It's the class
best suited to take advantage of the Drain feats. It might not need anything else.







--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New classes

I want to rebalance these because while I think they're very good on paper, I think that they come up short on gameplay
We'll look at each class by "situation": combat, skills, feats, and powers

Low Save			= Base 0, Gain on 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29



Skill Situation:

Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I used to have this figured out
This is quite difficult
Maybe we should do it by character first


Fack it, skills are bullshit that can't be fixed



Feat Situation:

Soldier:
-Armor: 	Level 3
-Blasters: 	Level 3
-Melee: 	Level 2

High Feats 		= Base 3, Gain on 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31
Medium Feats 	= Base 3, Gain on 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30
Low Feats		= Base 1, Gain on 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31





Force Situation:


Jedi Guardian
-Force Points:	4 Points per Level
-Spell Gain:	Low

Jedi Sentinel
-Force Points:	3 Points per Level
-Spell Gain:	Medium

Jedi Consular
-Force Points:	7 Points per Level
-Spell Gain:	High



Exile Spell Gain:

-High	 	= Base 0, Gain on 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 etc
-Medium	 	= Base 0, Gain on 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 etc
-Low		= Base 0, Gain on 2, 3, 6, 9, 15, etc


Everyone Else:

-High	 	= Base 2, Gain on 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 etc
-Medium	 	= Base 2, Gain on 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 etc
-Low		= Base 2, Gain on 3, 6, 9, 15 etc


Basically it's just the same as the feat gains but rounded down
to nearest multiple of 3
Note that instead of having High gain on 4, 10, etc you could
just double the powers on level 3, 9, etc

Alternately 

-High	 	= Base 2, Gain on 3, 6(2), 9, 12(2), 15 etc
-Medium	 	= Base 2, Gain on 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 etc
-Low		= Base 2, Gain on 3, 6, 12, 15 etc

Basically Medium gets powers every 3 levels
High gets the same + an extra power every 6 levels
Low gets the same - powers every 9 levels
Remember this is because powers become unlocked on levels which are multiples of 3
