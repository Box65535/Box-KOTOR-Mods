A character's force power can be calculated like so:

Start with the Charisma Modifier

Spell Power also gets the following class bonuses:

Jedi Consular - Base 1, Gain on 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29
Other Jedi - Base 0, Gain on 3, 5, 9, 11, 15, 17, 21, 23, 27, 29

Jedi Apprentice - Base 1, Gain every level
HOWEVER you have to make a special calculation in this case

For Jedi Apprentice, take the total level of the character who is the apprentice
Calculate the Spell Power if a Non-Consular Jedi had that total level
If the Spell Power calculated above is greater than this new value, use the new value


Each character can also gain up to 5 points with feats, 1 point per feat
Some other bonuses may be available as well


Spell Power + d10 is compared against Spell DC
Spell Power is -1 for every 5 points out of alignment past 40/60
Spell Power penalties are reduced by 1 for every Chr modifier


Characters also use Spell Power to calculate a spell DC against which other characters have to save
That value is calculated as

Spell Power + 10
