Enemy Attack High = (Player Defense High) higher?
Enemy Attack Medium = (Player Defense High)

Enemy Defense High = (Player Attack Medium)
Enemy Defense Medium = (Player Attack Low)

Enemy Saivng Throw High = (+1 every 2 levels)
Enemy Saivng Throw Medium = (+1 every 3 levels)

Enemy Awareness High = (+1 3 of every 4 levels)
Enemy Awareness Medium = (+1 every 2 levels)

Enemy Stealth High = (+1 3 of every 4 levels)
Enemy Stealth Medium = (+1 every 2 levels)

So then, how does this work?


10/26/2015:

I'm sure I did a thing were I recorded all of the enemy types in the game but now I can't seem to find it
Anyway we need enemy types:

Based on in-game files for K1/TSL:

-War Droid (1, 2, 3, 4)
-Wookie (1, 2)
-Wraid (1, 2)
-Xor
-Ziagrom

This has some things but it really isn't even close, I'm going to have to go through the whole list and even then I don't know what they may have reused, this is a real pain


Alright so the idea here is:

-We have 3 levels of enemies except bosses
-Each of them are pretty close together in terms of strength
-Lowest level are the complete cannon fodder enemies
-Middle levels supposed to indicate a moderate challenge, they're noticeably stronger but they shouldn't take much effort to defeat
-Highest level are challenging opponents, reserved for leaders and minibosses

None of these are bosses


So we have 3 tiers of enemies and we have several enemy categories that define how in general each of these enemies behave

Categories:
-Soldiers (TSF, Czerka, Sith, Mandalorian)
-Sith Assassins
-Dark Jedi (Regular Jedi?)
-Droids (Do we need separate categories?)
-Creatures (Kinrath, Shyrack, Kath Hound, Cannok, etc)
-Thugs (Various alein types)
-Turret (Same as droid?)

Alright small sub-categories aside let's specify the categories in terms of stats:


Class Attack 1  = Base 1, Gain on 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30
Class Attack 2  = Base 0, Gain on 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26, 27, 29

High Defense 	= Base 1, Gain on 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29
Medium Defense 	= Base 0, Gain on 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 19, 21, 23, 27, 29

Saving Throw High = 1 every 2 levels
Saving Throw Medium = 1 every 2.5 levels
Saving Throw Low = 1 every 3 levels

Awareness High = 1 every level
Awareness Medium = 3/4 every level
Awareness Low = 1/2 every level


Basically:
Class Attack 1 >
Class Attack 2 = High Defense >
Class Attack 3 = Medium Defense >
Low Defense

Strong Armor =	DT=2, +1 every 6 levels
Medium Armor =	DT=1, +1 every 6 levels except 18,36,54..
Weak Armor =	DT=0, +1 every 12 levels
No Armor =		DT=0, +0


Attack Category High	=	Medium/Medium/High
Attack Category Low		=	Medium/Medium/Medium

Defense Category High	=	Medium/Medium/High
Defense Category Low	=	Medium/Medium/Medium

Armor Category VStrong	=	Medium/Medium/Strong
Armor Category Strong	=	Weak/Medium/Medium
Armor Category Medium	=	Weak/Weak/Medium
Armor Category Weak		=	No/Weak/Weak
Armor Category None		=	No/No/No

Save Category High		=	Medium/Medium/High
Save Category Medium	=	Low/Medium/High
Save Category Low		=	Low/Medium/Medium

Skill Category High		=	Medium/Medium/High
Skill Category Medium	=	Low/Medium/High
Skill Category Low		=	Low/Medium/Medium
Skill Category VLow		=	Low/Low/Medium


Saves Fortitude High:
-Fortitude		- Medium/Medium/High
-Reflex			- Low/Medium/High
-Will			- Low/Medium/High

Saves Fortitude Full:
-Fortitude		- Medium/Medium/High
-Reflex			- Low/Medium/Medium
-Will			- Low/Medium/Medium

Saves Balanced:
-Fortitude		- Low/Medium/High
-Reflex			- Low/Medium/High
-Will			- Low/Medium/High

-Attack		- High
-Defense	- Low
-Armor		- Strong
-Saves		- Fortitude High
-Skills		- Medium
