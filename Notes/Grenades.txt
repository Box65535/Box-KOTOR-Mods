I think I'm satisfied with the above but we have to move on to the harder part of actual auxilary weapons - grenades and otherwise

I'm not satisfied with the sequencing here, I think it needs to work more like the sequencing of range weapons where there are distinct tiers but there can be some gradual improvement over time with upgrades

Also we've decided to do a thing where we separate explosives from other auxilary weapons, that is:

-Weapon Proficiency: Grenade Launchers
-Weapon Proficiency: Rocket Launchers
-Weapon Proficiency: Auxilary Weapons
-Weapon Proficiency: Heavy Auxilary Weapons

Also, I think we can justify the disparity in power by making grenades/launchers expensive, at least I don't know another better way to do it because otherwise grenades are just too weak

Alright my original idea didn't work so we have to make grenades with harsher

Also since auxilary weapons never really took off as an idea, I have a new plan

For auxilary weapons, there's only one feat required for them, and similarly, there's only one tier of equippable weapons, the difference is that instead of changing the weapon to upgrade it, you just change the ammunition type

So for example, you have a flamethrower weapon:
-At tier 1, you have regular flamethrower fuel
-At tier 2, you have some stronger fuel
-At tier 3, you have plasma fuel or whatever

These weapons wouldn't be as strong as the grenade launchers and energy weapons since they still only require one feat but they would have some sequencing and they would provide 

Also you could do grenades the same way if you wanted to enforce animations, you could create an item called the "Grenade Dispenser" or something which allows the use of grenades similarly to other auxilary weapons

That idea made me wonder about doing the following sequence

Auxilary Weapons -> Grenade Launchers -> Rocket Launchers

Well it's an idea, certainly weapons with AOE are better than those without
