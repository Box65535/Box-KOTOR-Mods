While they may have borrowed liberally from designs the Bothans initiated, the Verpine say you can't argue with results. These weapons are simply devastating against droids.

While ion weapons are generally less damaging against organic opponents, they are powerful against droids. Also, ion damage can penetrate some defenses blaster fire cannot. Ion weapons cannot utilize most power pack upgrades.
EOV


KEY: wr_disrup3
Upgradeable (Scope, Chamber)

This disruptor has all the modifications an assasin droid needs: improved optics, reduced recoil, extended range, and several open ports for even more modular upgrades.
EOV


KEY: wr_sonic3
Upgradeable (Scope)

More powerful than the pistol, the sonic rifle fires a blast of sound that causes a great deal of sensory overload in addition to damage, disorienting the victim.
EOV


KEY: wr_assaul3
Fully Upgradeable

These weapons are almost overpowered for their size, but the Mandalorians prefer them that way. They do not make a habit of being subtle in their war making.
EOV


KEY: wr_exchan3
Not Upgradeable

Trandoshan bounty hunters will use this weapon to capture their victims alive. As it is a carbine, it cannot be upgraded.
EOV


KEY: wr_sniper3

Despite its effectiveness, these modified blaster rifles are not often employed by the Sith. They prefer to engage their enemies up close and personal.
EOV


KEY: wr_plasma3

KEY: wr_sonicd3
Upgradeable (Scope)

Combining both sonic and disruptor attacks, this rifle tears through enemy defenses.
EOV


KEY: wr_mand3
Upgradeable (Chamber, Scope)

A weapon similar to this disruptor belonged to Jigger Wraith, a bounty hunter who plagued the Republic years ago. Thirty-seven Mandalorians were executed for being him until sightings declined. As a type of disruptor, this weapon ignores most personal energy shields.
EOV


KEY: wr_zabrak3
Not Upgradeable

The design of the Zabrak Combat Rifle is too complicated to allow further upgrading. Fortunately, it has little need for additional enhancement.
EOV

EOV


KEY: wm_long
Upgradeable (Edge, Grip)

Here is where the roots of the lightsaber begin, with traditional swords still wielded today in many primitive cultures. They are simple, but effective in the right hands.
EOV


KEY: wm_quarter
Upgradeable (Grip)

Usually just a smooth staff of wood or light alloys, this is a very simple weapon of ancient design.
EOV


KEY: wm_dblade
Upgradeable (Edge, Grip)

A difficult weapon to master, the double-bladed sword has a grip in the center with two long blades emerging from either end. The double-bladed sword is capable of inflicting more damage - but is also less precise - than the single-bladed variant. Using a two-bladed sword expertly requires skill in Two-Weapon Fighting.
EOV


KEY: wm_baton
Not Upgradeable

Stun Batons are commonly employed by police forces who prefer to incapacitate instead of kill their targets.
EOV


KEY: wm_pike

This weapon effectively functions as a long staff topped with a vibroblade. Despite its name, it is not related to the Force mastered by Jedi, though it is a powerful weapon in its own right.
EOV

EOV

Ultrasonic generators power this Echani-developed weapon design. A cortosis weave that protects against sparring damage ensures that traditional swordplay will endure in the time of lightsabers.
EOV

KEY: wm_vdoubl
Fully Upgradeable

Ultrasonic vibrations make this double-bladed sword exceptionally deadly. An Echani cortosis weave protects it against lightsaber sparring damage, ensuring effectiveness even against Jedi and Sith. The double-bladed sword is capable of inflicting more damage - but is also less precise - than the single-bladed variant. Two-Weapon Fighting is required to use a double-bladed sword with maximum effectiveness.
EOV

KEY: wm_exchan

A useful tool for espionage, this weapon is more effective than the standard stun baton, but is still available on most worlds.

Gamorrean war axes, much like their namesake species, are heavy, unsubtle, and generally a very damaging influence in almost any situation.
EOV

Not Upgradeable

This serrated weapon inflicts great pain upon its victims. Its design is unsuitable for weapon upgrades.
EOV

EOV


KEY: wm_trand
Not Upgradeable

While most cultures abandoned the primitive sword in favor of vibroblades or other weapons, the Trandoshan sometimes use the weapon as a badge of honor. This variant is made of the rare ore Chalon, and is sharper and heavier than the typical blade. They are not suitable for weapon upgrades, however.
EOV

In addition to a cortosis weave that deflects lightsaber sparring damage, some Echani vibroswords are supercooled to keep them in alignment, giving them an icy sting.
EOV


KEY: wm_shyarn
Not Upgradeable

This primitive looking weapon hails from the Cerean species, who employ it in traditional honor duels. It is crafted with ancient techniques and rare metals. Shyarn are magnetically attracted to each other, often locking together during parries. This strange property results in duels that are amazing and deadly dances of survival.
EOV


KEY: wm_gammor2

The impressive Arg'garok is the most prized Gamorrean weapon. These huge axes are designed to be wielded by those with a low center of gravity and tremendous strength, making them awkward for most non-Gamorreans to use.
EOV


KEY: wm_geonos
