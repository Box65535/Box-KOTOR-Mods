Cells:

Okay, so here's the thing.
I recently decided that Cells would be a good thing
to not have a whole bunch of since only a small
number of weapons use them and they should have a
definite but niche use.
Anyway, I don't want to get rid of the old Cells
but I need a new group so we'll just put the real
ones first and then the old ones after.

Note that these are not meant to be orthogonally
equilvalent.

We're going to separate out the upgrades into several tiers

Feel free to make many tiers and don't worry about the separation between them



If you want to redo this, take a look at the ranged weapons one, I think it's generally better

Tier 1:
-Metal Edge 1
-[Poison 1] Edge

Tier 2:
-[Aggressive 1] Grip
-[Passive 1] Grip
-[Defensive 1] Grip

Tier 3:
-[Paralyze 1] Edge
-[Ion 1] Edge
-[Critical 1] Edge

Tier 4:
-[Vibration] Cell
-[Energy] Cell
-[Zabrak 1] Grip
-[Balanced 1] Grip

Tier 5:
-Metal Edge 2
-[Poison 2] Edge
-[Sharp] Edge

Tier 6:
-[Aggressive 2] Grip
-[Passive 2] Grip
-[Defensive 2] Grip
-[Critical 2] Edge

Tier 7:
-[Paralyze 2] Edge
-[Energy] Edge
-[Electrical] Cell

Tier 8:
-Metal Edge 3
-[Ion 2] Edge
-[Critical 3] Edge
-[Balanced 1.1] Grip

Tier 9:
-[Sonic] Cell
-[Plasma] Cell

Tier 10:
-[Aggressive 3] Grip
-[Passive 3] Grip
-[Defensive 3] Grip

Tier 11:
-Metal Edge 4
-[Heated] Edge
-[Chilling] Edge

Tier 12:
-[Zabrak 2] Grip
-[Balanced 2] Grip



Okay, we have 12 tiers so now let's figure out the separation between them
We want assign a raw level at which each of the following can be reached


Tier 1 		- Level 2
Tier 2 		- Level 4
Tier 3 		- Level 6
Tier 4 		- Level 8
Tier 5 		- Level 10
Tier 6 		- Level 12
Tier 7 		- Level 14
Tier 8 		- Level 16
Tier 9 		- Level 18
Tier 10		- Level 20
Tier 11		- Level 22
Tier 12		- Level 24


Hmmmmmmmmmmmm, seems legit
