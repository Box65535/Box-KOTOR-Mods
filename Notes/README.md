These notes are more for my reference than anything. I wouldn't recommend trying to read them because a lot of the stuff here is wrong or no longer up to date, even the stuff that isn't in the Old folder. Basically, these are temporary notes that I use to keep track of things as I'm developing them, not documentation.
