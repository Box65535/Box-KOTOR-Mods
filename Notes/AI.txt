First we might want to separate party and enemy AI, mainly because we want AI to be a little more balanced whereas we want party AI to be strictly optimal to reduce the need for manual party control


We have 4 Party AI types:

-Aggressive
-Ranged
-Stationary
-Grenadier/Jedi Support

I think these should roughly translate to:

-Offensive
-Defensive
-Stationary
-Support

Then we can differentiate based on equipped weapons and available spells

Ok, let's start with offensive I guess

Offensive:
-Melee prioritize close enemies first then chase ranged
-Ranged target near-death enemies first then chase ranged
-Switch to melee if attacked at melee range
-Switch to ranged if not being attacked at melee
-Don't switch if unarmed, don't switch into unarmed
-Liberal use of combat feats
-Conservative use of buffs and other spells

Defensive:
-Stay close to party leader
-Ranged don't leave party leader radius
-Melee only leave party leader radius to attack enemies attacking party, don't chase
-Prioritize attacking enemies attacking party leader, or enemies party leader is attacking
-First priority is always attacking enemies attacking you at melee range
-Switch to melee if attacked at melee range
-Switch to ranged if not being attacked at melee
-Conservative use of combat feats
-Very conservative use of buffs and other spells

Stationary:
-Don't move
-Liberal use of combat feats when not being attacked
-Liberal use of spells that can attack at range
-Otherwise, same as Defensive

Support:
-Liberal use of spells
-Prioritize party buffing spells or AOE spells
-Otherwise, similar to Defensive


Then we need to specify how feats and spells are picked but we'll do that later
