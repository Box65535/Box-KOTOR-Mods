Alright so this is where we're going to try to analyze and balance the powers because it
really wasn't working last time. In general they need a buff.

Firstly, I'm considering going from saving at 5 + (3/5)*Level to 5 + (2/3)*Level since the
numbers were just so low. If this was done I think a -2 modifier to all multi-target
spells should be applied.

Also, if any spell is saved with an excess of 10 points over the DC, then the spell should
have absolutely no effect rather than it's save effect

Anyway, we'll split these up into attacking and buffing powers, starting with the
attacking ones


[4/17/2013, I believe this is the most recent implementation of
 force powers and should already be coded in k_inc_force.... maybe]

New Force Powers
--------------------------------------------------------


So it turns out we wanted to create new powers anyway
This utilizes a new system that simplifies acquiring powers
Basically each power has a DC to meet before it can be used
Also each power gets stronger as you level up, not just offensive ones
Consulars etc get the ability to unlock special versions of powers that do multitargetting, otherwise only single-target spells are allowed


Before we go into powers, we have to briefly explain cast DC
Each power has a DC that needs to be met by the user before the power can even used
Different classes gain modifiers that can be used on this DC at different rates
There is also a set of 5 feats that raise these modifiers by 1 each
Finally, modifiers to Charisma also act as modifiers to this cast DC

Okay, now in more depth

Consulars etc get Level/1.5 as their class modifier
Other Jedi classes get Level/3 as their class modifier
Non-Jedi classes get Level/6 as their class modifier

Partial points count when changing classes because we can work with non-integers
