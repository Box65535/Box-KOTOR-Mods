The poison grenade deals damage while the nerve grenade attempts to choke enemies. Because the grenades use gas, opponents must save using their Fortitude instead of Reflex and neither grenade is effective against droids.EOVKEY: wl_sonicThis launcher is for deploying sonic charges. Sonic grenades bypass most defenses and can disorient those hit by them.EOVKEY: wl_coldThis launcher deploys grenades that expand into solid matter. Both CryoBan and adhesive grenades are effective at stopping crowds of enemies in their tracks.EOVKEY: wl_plasmaThis launcher works with grenades that work by releasing energy. These types of grenades deal high amounts of damage. Ion grenades are effective against droids while plasma grenades devestate weak enemies.EOVKEY: wl_rocketThis is the basic rocket launcher. Rockets are stronger than grenades but are considerably more expensive. This launcher works with regular explosive rockets and incendiary rockets for burning enemies.EOVKEY: wl_busterThis rocket launcher is specially designed for buster rockets.

It is a dual launcher that can fire thermal detonators as ballstic projectiles as well as fusion rockets. This makes this launcher arguably the most deadly weapon that a single soldier can carry into battle.EOVKEY: wr_blast1Fully UpgradeableThe most common ranged weapon in the galaxy is the basic blaster pistol, firing a bolt of intense coherent light powered by a replaceable power pack.EOVKEY: wr_hold1Fully UpgradeableThe Hold Out Blaster l is a versatile back-up weapon. Though modest in performance, it is fully upgradeable.EOVKEY: wr_ion1Upgradeable (Chamber, Scope)This standard Ion Blaster is commonly issued to Republic troops as a secondary weapon.While ion weapons are generally less damaging against organic opponents, they are powerful against droids. Also, ion damage can penetrate some defenses blaster fire cannot. Ion weapons cannot utilize most power pack upgrades.EOVKEY: wr_disrup1Upgradeable (Chamber, Scope)These pistols are illegal in many planetary systems, being regarded as too powerful a weapon to be owned by civilians. Disruptors reduce solid matter to its constituent molecules. Unlike typical blasters, disruptors ignore most types of personal energy shields.EOVKEY: wr_sonic1Upgradeable (Scope)Sometimes referred to as "squealers", these weapons deliver a high-frequency jolt to the senses that can damage and potentially disorient an opponent.Sonic weapons can temporarily reduce an opponent's Wisdom.EOVKEY: wr_heavy1Fully UpgradeableThese resemble regular blasters in the same way Quoorian marshsuckers resemble mosquitoes. Sure, they both do damage, but the former definitely has the edge in kill potential.EOVKEY: wr_mining1Not UpgradeableThis industrial hand-held laser can double as a makeshift blaster.EOVKEY: wr_blast2Fully UpgradeableThe Republic Blaster can be fully upgraded with firing chamber, targeting scope, and power cell.EOVKEY: wr_hold2Fully UpgradeableWhen fully upgraded, these survival pistols can match the best heavy blaster in performance. Their stun capabilites make them an excellent off-hand weapon.EOVKEY: wr_ion2Upgradeable (Chamber, Scope)The Verpine Ion Blaster is designed to be capable against all types of opponents, replacing the need to carry a second anti-droid side arm.While ion weapons are generally less damaging against organic opponents, they are powerful against droids. Also, ion damage can penetrate some defenses that will stop typical blaster fire. Ion weapons cannot utilize most power pack upgrades.EOVKEY: wr_disrup2Upgradeable (Chamber, Scope)The Sith disruptor design is compatible with most types of blaster upgrades.EOVKEY: wr_sonic2Upgradeable (Scope)Though inferior in damage potential to traditional blasters, this sonic blaster's advanced design makes it a viable weapon, especially in long combats when its deafening capabilities can accumulate.Sonic weapons can temporarily reduce an opponent's Wisdom. Additionally, many types of shields and defenses are ineffective against sonic attacks. EOVKEY: wr_heavy2Fully UpgradeableMandalorians improved upon the standard heavy blaster design, creating a weapon that is both fully upgradeable and superior to the standard design.EOVKEY: wr_elec2Upgradeable (Scope)This unusual weapon was originally developed for use against veermok, a ferocious primate on Naboo that happens to be resistant to blaster fire. Much of the weapon's damage is electrical in nature, allowing it to bypass blaster resistance.EOVKEY: wr_assass2Fully UpgradeableThese weapons are designed to incapacitate so death may be quick or lingered upon as desired. Droids are simply dispatched, as cruelty is best rationed among the living.EOVKEY: wr_plasma2Upgradeable (Chamber, Scope)This capable side-arm is at the top of Aratech's ion blaster line. It is designed for multi-purpose use.EOVKEY: wr_mand2Upgradeable (Chamber, Scope)Not surprisingly, the most deadly disruptor pistol available is of Mandalorian design. Use of this ruthless weapon is a major violation of Republic code.EOVKEY: wr_sonicd2Upgradeable (Scope)The Dashade are a secretive and vicious species made infamous by their renowned assassins. Their weapons of choice are best known for the extreme pain they inflict. This improved model combines the best features of sonic and disruptor pistols.EOVKEY: wr_zabrak2Not UpgradeableA more cumbersome, but also more damaging, blaster of Zabrak design.EOVKEY: wr_darkNot UpgradeableA vile weapon that once belonged to Freedon Nadd, this blaster has killed more Jedi then any lightsaber.EOVKEY: wr_carbin3Not UpgradeableBlaster carbine rifles are inelegant, but effective weapons. They are commonly used by unskilled thugs and mercenaries.EOVKEY: wr_blast3Fully UpgradeableMore powerful than the commonly available pistol, the blaster rifle is favored by soldiers throughout the galaxy. Civilian ownership of these weapons is not generally encouraged.  Unlike carbines, most rifles can be fully upgraded.EOVKEY: wr_ion3Upgradeable (Chamber, Scope)While they may have borrowed liberally from designs the Bothans initiated, the Verpine say you can't argue with results. These weapons are simply devastating against droids.While ion weapons are generally less damaging against organic opponents, they are powerful against droids. Also, ion damage can penetrate some defenses blaster fire cannot. Ion weapons cannot utilize most power pack upgrades.EOVKEY: wr_disrup3Upgradeable (Scope, Chamber)This disruptor has all the modifications an assasin droid needs: improved optics, reduced recoil, extended range, and several open ports for even more modular upgrades.EOVKEY: wr_sonic3Upgradeable (Scope)More powerful than the pistol, the sonic rifle fires a blast of sound that causes a great deal of sensory overload in addition to damage, disorienting the victim.EOVKEY: wr_assaul3Fully UpgradeableThese weapons are almost overpowered for their size, but the Mandalorians prefer them that way. They do not make a habit of being subtle in their war making.EOVKEY: wr_exchan3Not UpgradeableTrandoshan bounty hunters will use this weapon to capture their victims alive. As it is a carbine, it cannot be upgraded.EOVKEY: wr_sniper3Fully UpgradeableDespite its effectiveness, these modified blaster rifles are not often employed by the Sith. They prefer to engage their enemies up close and personal.EOVKEY: wr_plasma3Upgradeable (Chamber, Scope)This massive weapon fires a bolt of plasma energy at its target. It is difficult to wield except by highly trained marksmen.EOVKEY: wr_sonicd3Upgradeable (Scope)Combining both sonic and disruptor attacks, this rifle tears through enemy defenses.EOVKEY: wr_mand3Upgradeable (Chamber, Scope)A weapon similar to this disruptor belonged to Jigger Wraith, a bounty hunter who plagued the Republic years ago. Thirty-seven Mandalorians were executed for being him until sightings declined. As a type of disruptor, this weapon ignores most personal energy shields.EOVKEY: wr_zabrak3Not UpgradeableThe design of the Zabrak Combat Rifle is too complicated to allow further upgrading. Fortunately, it has little need for additional enhancement.EOVKEY: wr_blast4Fully UpgradeableThis weapon allows the user to fire more quickly than usual, increasing his chances of survival without drastically changing the amount of equipment he would normally carry.EOVKEY: wr_sonicd4Upgradeable (Scope)These weapons were employed by the elite troops of Iziz during the Battle of Onderon. The power of these carbines, combined with their high rate of fire, was believed to play a considerable role in the rout of the Mandalorian forces.EOVKEY: wr_sith4Fully UpgradeableEOVKEY: wr_plasma4Upgradeable (Chamber, Scope)EOVKEY: wr_hk4Upgradeable (Chamber, Scope)EOVKEY: wr_mand4Fully UpgradeableWith this weapon, the Mandalorians again demonstrate a complete lack of subtlety. The only thing better than a big blaster, apparently, is one that shoots faster.EOVKEY: wr_zabrak4Not UpgradeableEOVKEY: wr_bow1Not UpgradeableEOVKEY: wr_bow2Not UpgradeableEOVKEY: wm_shortUpgradeable (Edge, Grip)Disregarded by most modern warriors, a good short sword can still serve well in combat if the user is skilled.EOVKEY: wm_longUpgradeable (Edge, Grip)Here is where the roots of the lightsaber begin, with traditional swords still wielded today in many primitive cultures. They are simple, but effective in the right hands.EOVKEY: wm_quarterUpgradeable (Grip)Usually just a smooth staff of wood or light alloys, this is a very simple weapon of ancient design.EOVKEY: wm_dbladeUpgradeable (Edge, Grip)A difficult weapon to master, the double-bladed sword has a grip in the center with two long blades emerging from either end. The double-bladed sword is capable of inflicting more damage - but is also less precise - than the single-bladed variant. Using a two-bladed sword expertly requires skill in Two-Weapon Fighting.EOVKEY: wm_batonNot UpgradeableStun Batons are commonly employed by police forces who prefer to incapacitate instead of kill their targets.EOVKEY: wm_pikeNot UpgradeableThis weapon effectively functions as a long staff topped with a vibroblade. Despite its name, it is not related to the Force mastered by Jedi, though it is a powerful weapon in its own right.EOVKEY: wm_plasmaNot Upgradeable?EOVKEY: wm_vbladeFully UpgradeableSmall size makes this a good off-hand weapon. Echani vibroblades use a cortosis weave to prevent lightsaber sparring damage, allowing traditional swordplay to continue in the time of Jedi and Sith.EOVKEY: wm_vswordFully UpgradeableUltrasonic generators power this Echani-developed weapon design. A cortosis weave that protects against sparring damage ensures that traditional swordplay will endure in the time of lightsabers.EOVKEY: wm_vdoublFully UpgradeableUltrasonic vibrations make this double-bladed sword exceptionally deadly. An Echani cortosis weave protects it against lightsaber sparring damage, ensuring effectiveness even against Jedi and Sith. The double-bladed sword is capable of inflicting more damage - but is also less precise - than the single-bladed variant. Two-Weapon Fighting is required to use a double-bladed sword with maximum effectiveness.EOVKEY: wm_exchanNot UpgradeableA useful tool for espionage, this weapon is more effective than the standard stun baton, but is still available on most worlds.EOVKEY: wm_gammor1Upgradeable (Grip)Gamorrean war axes, much like their namesake species, are heavy, unsubtle, and generally a very damaging influence in almost any situation.EOVKEY: wm_zabrakNot UpgradeableThough believed to have been constructed by the Zabrak, this vibroblade is rarely used by them. The Zabrak feel their combat skills sufficient to make this weapon's fine balance irrelevant.EOVKEY: wm_rodianNot UpgradeableThis serrated weapon inflicts great pain upon its victims.
