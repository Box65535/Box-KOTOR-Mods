I was very satisfied with how the shields work previously but now we can do a few things to update them I think:

We only need two feats for energy sheilds but we still need separate shields for humans and droids due to different equipment slots

There was a problem with the whole Zabrak/Universal shields being way better than any others so I increased their charge times
I am not really satisfied with this solution however since it's very crippling, it might be better to just make them much more expensive or something
What this does prove is that you can have a good 2-tier progression even if you don't have a wide variety of items, you just need to provide a niche for each tier
