The following are required:

-Awareness must handle awareness
-Stealth must handle stealth
-Security must handle doors
-Demolitions must handle traps
-Droids cannot use Treat Injury
-Droids cannot use Stealth (except G0t0)
-Empathy gives bonuses to Awareness, Treat Injury, Persuade
-Persuade can only be used by main character



What you want:

-All combat/non-combat skills to be separated
-All crafting/non-crafting skills to be separated
-2 different crafting skills
-Not having repairs and hacking use the same skill
-Only Persuasion should be restricted to main character
-Empathy should not give bonuses to something random
-Droids should only be restricted from things they absolutely can't do


Consequences:
-Awareness and Stealth cannot change
-Extra things cannot be added to Persuade
-Demolitions can only expand to include more combat stuff
-Treat Injury can only expand to include more combat stuff or be eliminated

More Consequences:
-This leaves Security, Computer Use, and Repair as non-combat skills
-Computer Use and Repair must be crafting skills only
-Security cannot include both repairing and hacking
-So we have a contradiction




But Wait, What if we don't consider traps to be a combat ability?:
-Repairing and hacking must be split between Demolitions and Security
-If we assign hacking to Security, and repairing to Demolitions, it works
-We cannot have any combat skills for demolitions
-Any bonuses to droid weapons, demolitions, and repair kits can't be expressed in skills





So based on this answer, we have the following skills:

Persuade - same as before
Awareness - same as before
Stealth - same as before

Treat Injury - effectivness with healing/medkits
Repair - use of mines, repairing
Security - opening doors, hacking

Craft - crafting objects at workbench
Chemicals - crafting objects at med station



Things not included in skills:
-Grenade bonuses
-Mine bonuses
-Stimulant bonuses
-Repair kit bonuses
-Droid weapon bonuses

This is the main sacrifice that is made, that so many things here cannot be included



Implimentation requirements:

-Move repairing functionality to Demolitions
-Move hacking functionality to Security
-Rename Demolitions -> Repair
-Rename Repair -> Craft
-Rename Computer Use -> Chemicals
-Adjust dialogue options to reflect new skills [play by ear]



Only note is that I think when it comes to dialogue options, you are going to have to be willing to write a few extra lines of dialogue if necessary to work things out






Alright so what about which classes get which skills?:

Well, I've been thinking about this a bit
There was a problem where there weren't enough skill options for classes
Therefore, I think it makes sense to give all classes access to all skills as class skills after using a feat to do so
The question is whether to require an intermediate feat
For now, we'll list them as Free, Available, and Unlisted


Instead of listing out every skill, how about a general framework:
-There are several classes of skills: Persuade, Awareness, Treat Injury, Stealth, Technical
-Tehnical = Repair + Craft + Chemicals + Security
-Almost everyone gets Awareness
-Scout, Scoundrel get one technical
-Tech Specialist, Expert Droid get two technicals but no awareness
-The non-technicals only require one feat to use
-The technicals require a prereq feat to use
-Droids get the prereq feat for free
-Jedi get no technicals unless the main character who gets 1-2


So this is the consequence of this:

Solider:
-Awareness

Scout:
-Awareness
-Repair

Scoundrel:
-Awareness
-Security

Tech Specialist:
-Repair
-Craft

Combat Droid:
-Awareness

Expert Droid:
-Repair
-Security

Jedi Guardian:
-Awareness
*Repair

Jedi Scoundrel:
-Awareness
*Chemicals
*Security

Jedi Consular:
-Awareness
*Craft

Jedi Watchman:
*Craft
*Chemicals

Sith Assassin:
*Repair
*






FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK


I don't like this

Because

Demolitions is gone as a combat skill which means we're one short

And all the items that assumed Demolitions was combat based don't work

Fack!


No, the best solution here is to work on eliminating this thing:

-All crafting/non-crafting skills to be separated
-2 different crafting skills


Basically, what if we made 3 crafting skills which each did slightly different things:
-2 for workbench
-1 for med station

Right now the items are configured for the following technical skills:
-Repair
-Computer Use
-Security

We want to change this to:
-Chemicals
-Mechanics
-Computers

No I don't like this either:

Here's the problem in a nutshell:

-You want 4 combat skills
-You want 4 non-combat skills
-You have 7 skills total
-You don't want any crossover between skills

Okay? Something has to go. We have to limit either combat or non-combat skills to 3 or have a hybrid skill. There's no other way. We can't make 8 skills. Persuade won't work.

So there are 3 options:
-Reduce combat skills to 3
-Reduce non-combat skills to 3
-Reduce both skills to 3 but also get a hybrid skill

Things that need to exist on the combat side:
-Awareness
-Stealth
-Treat Injury

Things that need to exist on the non-combat side:
-Security/Computers
-Craft
-Repair

So what does that leave in the middle as potential removals/hybrids:
-Demolitions
-Chemicals


We COULD combine Craft and Repair into one skill but this makes a VERY powerful skill since Craft is already one of the best

An alternate is to combine Demolitions and Chemicals as a hybrid but the abilities of each skew heavily toward combat/non-combat so it's getting pulled in two directions

We have to pick one of these, probably


Is there a way to make Craft/Repair less powerful?:

Is there a way to fold Chemicals into something that already exists?:






Fack
This all has happened because you wanted to include skills for crafting
What if
Instead of doing that, you forgot all this skill-changing nonsense
And just made crafting feat-based
Eh?
Look, idk what the answer is
But having 8 skills is impossible
And even having 7 skills the way you've proposed could be really tricky
Is it really worth trying to make crafting be a skill? Is it?
Well, crafting wouldn't really fit very well into the feat system either
I've got a new idea
Free Crafting
There are no requirements for crafting items, just pay the components/chemicals and move on
I think that's what we have to do if we're ever going to get past this
Just do it that way for now and see about coming back to it later
It's just not worth trying to figure this out on this iteration because you're not satisfied with any solution for more than 2 hours
It's the way it has to be
Sorry
Wait no, we need some sort of level scaling
Just make it use the character's level in the script
Whatever man
I can't deal with this
It is very important to the design, but I just can't make the sacrifices necessary
As for the rest of the skill system
Do everything else first and then see what you can put together just to test the game for once
