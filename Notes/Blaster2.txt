This also works with the fact that there are 7 heavy weapons models in k2

OK, now I'm learning that repeating blasters actually attack twice per round
In that case.........
Well, we should make them something like 1d12-1d16
I mean that's actually really, really good when you consider upgrades and the fact that you dodge having to take the dual wield feats
You could even make it 1d10-1d12 but that's ehhhh maybe
